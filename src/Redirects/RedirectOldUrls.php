/**
 * Catches an address the old forum used to serve, and sends it where the
 * content went.
 *
 * 🚨 **Middleware rather than routes, and that is not a preference.** Half of
 * these addresses live in a QUERY STRING — `viewtopic.php?t=123`,
 * `index.php?topic=123.0` — which a router cannot express: to Flarum's router
 * every one of them is a request for `/index.php`. A middleware sees the whole
 * thing.
 *
 * 🚨 **It acts only once Flarum has failed to answer.** The old forum's shapes
 * are not Flarum's, but they are close enough to collide — Discourse's
 * `/t/slug/123` and Flarum's own `/t/{slug}` begin identically. Letting Flarum
 * go first means this can never take an address the site itself can serve.

         * as a 404, and this middleware was first written the other way round.**
         *
         * `ResolveRoute` THROWS when nothing matches; `HandleErrors`, further up
         * the stack, is what turns that into a 404 page. So a version of this
         * registered with `->add()` — at the END of the stack, below the
         * resolver — never had `process()` called for a single address it
         * exists to catch. It would have shipped, passed every test that did
         * not make a real request to a real missing page, and done nothing.
         *
         * 🚨 And there are TWO ways to be missing, which cost a second round of
         * this. `/t/123` from Discourse MATCHES Flarum's own `/t/{slug}` route,
         * so the router succeeds and the page fails afterwards, throwing
         * something else entirely. Catching only the router's exception left
         * every colliding shape — `/t/…`, `/u/…`, `/user/…` — still dead, which
         * is precisely the set this feature is hardest and most needed for.
         *
         * So: catch everything, and ask Flarum's OWN registry what the thing
         * would have become. If it was going to be a 404 there is nothing to
         * lose by trying; if it was going to be anything else it is rethrown
         * untouched, and the error page, its logging and its content
         * negotiation all behave as though this were not installed.
