 * every inbound link a forum ever had, and the person making it cannot check it
 * afterwards — a redirect that quietly resolves nothing looks exactly like one
 * that works, until the traffic does not arrive. So this returns real addresses
 * built from real rows in this site's own map, resolved for real, before
 * anybody presses anything.
